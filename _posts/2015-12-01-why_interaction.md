We learn history by attending to history lessons, chemistry, by attending to chemistry lessons, and so on. That is horribly obvious. But... where do we learn how to be nice? where do we learn what is good and bad for us? Where do we learn how to choose a person? Where do we learn what are our limits? What is the school subject that can teach how to communicate, to make business, to talk to a girl, to say the right things, to behave?

Ok, there is no school subject that deals with our behavior. Those subjects are supposedi to be taught at home, or while we learn history and chemistry. Of course that's completely silly. School could become a nest for a big number of bad behaviors, there is where we normally learn bad behaviors. Home could not always be the best place, and what can a couple of young novices teach to children?... Friends? Don't even think about it. The truth is that we don't know how to handle this kind of education. Not only us. Educators don't know how to handle this. Family should provide this learning, but parents are maybe more confused than students. If you think that education experts are doing a good job... sorry, you are completely wrong. Educators don't know how to handle this. And that is because despite we are on the XXI century and we have computers of 15 dollars, a lot of scientific knowledge is still not developed. We don't know why do we do a lot of things, we don't know a lot of reasons of our behavior.

But there is a subject that may deal exactly with that: interaction.

Yes, as stupid it sounds. There is a whole science behind -currently growing-. And it deals with how does each small interaction works and what benefits and damages it cause for each interactor.

An interaction means just an action and a reaction. It seems trivial, but in reality, an small action can lead to a big problem. Drugs, pregnancy at school, aggressivity, poverty, loneliness, greediness, all of them are the result of small and repeated actions. You may say that actions depend on each individual psychological profile, and that is true. But the psychological profile follows some rules: the rules of interaction. You can be bad, but you will not destroy a wall with your head. You follow the rules of nature: the rules of interaction.

We learn to interact since we born and we learn it every day, therefore our knowledge changes and can be changed in school.

The first type of interaction -after learning some basic movements with our body- is learning the physical properties of things. We touch, taste, smell, caress, hit, crash every object we have near us. We learn to interact not only with things, but with sounds, light, odors... etc. In the meantime, we learn the basics of personal interaction, during the experience with our mother. What is nice and what is not. Then we learn to speak an interact with other people. Then we start to learn interactions of higher complexity. How to answer, when to smile or get anger, when to scream. Then we go to school and learn other types of interaction.

But sadly, the learning of bad interactions has probably already started. We may learn to battle for our interests, and maybe we can learn how to cheat and lie... Wait, when was the moment when we became bad? We learn what are the results of each interaction, based on the knowledge we got at home, but we will confront that knowledge very fast and get our own conclusions. In fact, why should we be good?

The interaction principles say that interaction is the language of systems in nature, and that the main objective of interacting is to exist.

When mom told us to be honest, that may be because of a dogma she learned by child. But in fact, she is teaching us how to survive. Honesty increases the probabilities to hold more interactions on the future (like "he seems honest, I think I will do business with him" or "she seems honest, I believe her, I prefer talking with her")...

Interaction is a huge topic that deals precisely with all these subjects. There is not a moral, ethics or dogmas about being good. There are reasons, that are precisely explained by the principles of interaction.

If you think, moral rules, ethic, law, justice, etc. they allseem to be dogmas. That's why a lot of people don't respect them. But they have a reason to exist. All of them promote healthy interaction between us. Values like honesty or loyalty must not be taught as dogmas. The reason that we are honest and loyal is because they help us causing positive resultsto the others.The principles of interaction says that positive interactionresults cause attraction. That is not love attraction. But if you sell pencils and you are honest, you will attract more clients that if you'd be not honest. That's the type of attraction that positive interactions cause. And all moral, ethic, law, etc., help us to interact in a positive way.

People with experience -commonly old people-has only learned the best rules of interaction during their lives. But we can

Interactionis part of the dynamic systems theory, but applies in all, -yes, absolutely ALL- disciplines. You may find a lot of books about interaction on different subjects, but ageneral draft for a formalization of a Theory of Interactioncan be found here, despite it can be a bit heavy for anyone out of the systems theory subject.

Personally, I think that interaction -as an school subject- should enter informal education. If you are concerned with this, or current education, you can finda draft for an interaction manual for children onthis link.You can help writing it or translating it.
