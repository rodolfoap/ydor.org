Chaos: Lack of interaction between entities.

Content: Value (on ideal systems) or matter (in nature) that is transferred from one entity to another in order to interact.

Development: One of the two possible applications of a content ingestion. The content is incorporated to the structure of the system and starts interacting with it.

Dimension: Approach of contents processing.

Dissipation: Decrease of order in dimensional scale.

GST: General Systems Theory. Focuses on the system, the whole and permanent relations.

Horizontal Interaction: Interaction with systems on the same dimensional scale of existence.

Intelligence: Mechanism that directs the performance of the system towards perstability.

Interaction: Exchange of contents between two entities.

LFR: Local (for the local entity) Final (after the end of the interaction) Result (integration of all dimensional values).

Nonlinearity: Distinctive feature of interactions as a difference to relations.

Order: Dimensional arrangement that exists due to interaction. No interaction means no order.

Organization: Increment of dimensional scale order.

Perstability: Dynamic state that causes a system to persist continuously along time. The comprehensive meaning of the word life which includes all natural entities that persist along time.

Processing: The second possible application of a content ingestion. Contents are transformed and will not be incorporated as part of the structure.

Pull competition: Competition focused on the best LFR for the contender. Powerful chaos generator. Controls overpopulation by generating chaos on excedent entities.

Pull interaction: Type of interaction where the reaction to stimulus is performed by adding chaos to the outmost higher scale of existence.

Push competition: Competition focused on the best LFR for the group. Powerful population generator. Controls underpopulation by generating development of lacking entities.

Push interaction: Type of interaction where the reaction to stimulus is performed by applying internal capabilities.

Relation: Interaction that has reached a permanent repetitive state.

Subjectivity: Feature of a system that allows it to assess the value of a content regarding its internal set of capabilities.

Synergy: Aggregate of the interactions between two or more systems performing together plus the interactions of each system.

System: Group of parts that hold relations and perform together.

Time Row: Subjective assessment of a system regarding the sequence of an interaction.

TOI: Theory of Interaction. Focuses on interactions, fleeting events between couples of entities.

Vertical Interaction: Interaction with systems on a different dimensional scale of existence; supra or subsystems. Also fractal interaction.

YDOR: Graphical representation of an interaction instance.
