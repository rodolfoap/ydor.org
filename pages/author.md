## Rodolfo Alcazar Portillo

Worked on multiple fields (independent researcher, musician with 30 years of professional experience, systems architect with 25 years of professional experience). Main interest is developing a conceptual thinking framework to save the planet. That, because my research shows that all natural systems are logically coherent and consistent: acting wise, ecologically, generating growth, while decreasing poverty. Nature is essentially what we perceive as logical rules, and life persists only where no logical incoherences exist.
