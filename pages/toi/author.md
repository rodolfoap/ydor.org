## About the author

My name is Rodolfo Alcazar Portillo, born in Bolivia, currently live in France. Work on multiple fields (independent researcher, musician with 30 years of professional experience, systems architect with 25 years of professional experience). My main interest is developing a conceptual thinking framework to save the planet. That, because my research shows that everything is logically coherent: acting wise, ecologically, generating growth, while decreasing poverty. Nature is essentially what we perceive as logical rules, and life persists only where no logical incoherences exist.
